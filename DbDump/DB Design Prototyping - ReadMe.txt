DB Design Prototyping - ReadMe

The prototyping scripts are the next level of design for the system database. They were planned to become the new system database, but due to multiple complications it was decided to use a different database deisgn, with these complications detailed below.

The prototype scripts include a database design which has been normalized, as the current database has not been normalized. The original plan was to use the normalized design, but due to complications with re-working the backend to work with this design, it was decided to use the other design. Additionally, due to this change in the chosen database, the data generation scripts were changed to work with the non-normalized database design.
